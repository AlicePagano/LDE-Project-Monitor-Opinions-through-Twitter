# Paper template for Advanced Physics Laboratory Course

The template is organized as follow:

* main.tex : main file with latex source and some example to how insert figures and tables

* image/ : folder to insert graph and plots

* references.bib : file to insert bibliography references .bib

As a suggestion, it is better to compile it directly on Overleaf, because the subfigure settings can arise problems.

Template made by Alice Pagano and Francesca Dodici.
